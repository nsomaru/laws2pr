# 1. Ownership General


## Nature of Ownership
- Ownership is the only unlimited real right in a *res* by an owner
    - It is not truly unlimited: limited by law, statute
    - Most powerful and extensive right that a person can enjoy in property
- Limited real rights are the rights in respect of *another's* property
- Ownership entitlements:
    1. *Ius utendi* -- to **use/enjoy**; including the fruits (*ius fruendi*),
       natural and civil
    2. *Ius disponendi* -- to **alienate**; sell, donate or encumber
    3. *Ius vindicandi* -- to **vindicate**; demand return when another is in
       unlawful possession
    4. *Ius possidendi* -- to **possess**; physical control, exclusive access
    5. *Ius abutendi* -- to **destroy**;
- Ownership is an **abstract right**; a right in and of itself which exceeds the
    sum total of all entitlements.
    - One may relinquish all entitlements without relinquishing ownership; this
        is called **bare ownership**
- Ownership is a **reversionary right**; all entitlements revert back to the
    owner when they expire.
- Ownership has **limitations**:
    - by legislation
    - by transfer of entitlement (eg: contract)
    - by limited real rights granted (eg: servitude)


## Co-Ownership
- Almost all entitlements applying to individual ownership apply
- There may be any number of specifically identified owners:
    - property cannot be divided (**undivided share**)
        - each co-owner owns a part of every piece of the property; it is not
            possible to identify who owns which part of the *res*
    - share amounts may differ
    - each co-owner may deal with their shares as an owner would; sell or
        burden
    - individual co-owners cannot burden or alienate the property as a whole
        unilaterally
- **Free Co-Ownership**:
    - any co-owner may unilaterally terminate/burden his share
    - may end the co-ownership relationship unilaterally
    - property may need to be sold to realise a demand if the
        property is not legally divisible (depends on type of property)
- **Bound Co-Ownership**:
    - co-owners are bound by an underlying relationship
    - usually arises out of marriage COP which creates a single joint estate
        with 50% share, or business partners
    - cannot unilaterally terminate, ends with dissolution of the relationship
- There are 3 main ways that co-ownership comes about:
    1. Inheritance -- testator leaves some equal/unequal undivided shares -- free
    2. Contract -- persons agree to become co-owners -- free
    3. Marriage COP -- joint estate -- bound
- Co-ownership may be terminated by the common-law separation action, *actio
    communi dividundo*
    - prefarable to come to an agreement for termination without court
        intervention


## How Ownership is Acquired
- There are two main ways to acquire ownership:
    1. Original acquisition:
        - unilaterally transaction by operation of law
        - no consent of the previous owner is required (there might not be a
            previous owner)
        - the previous owner need not have knowledge
        - there is no transfer of title
        - there is *no dependence on the previous owner* at all
    2. Derivative acquisition:
        - bilateral; requires consent of both parties
        - title is derived from the previous owner, the *predecessor in title*
