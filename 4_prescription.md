# 4. Acquisition of Ownership: Prescription


## General
- "Acquisitive Prescription"
- Original acquisition of ownership
- Governed by Prescription Act 68 of 1969
    - not codifying -- some common-law principles still apply


## Requirements for Acquisitive Prescription
1. Possession
    - Open, as if owner (*nec clam*)
2. Time period of 30 years


### Possession
- Mental element (*animus*)
    - *Animus domini* = as if owner
        - not intention to **become owner**
    - Do not acknowledge any superior title
    - Regardless of *mala fide* or *bona fide* possession
        - easier to prove for *bona fide* possessor
    - Possession **contrary to the interests of the owner** is good evidence of
        *animus domini*
        - eg: lease does not apply because permission was obtained
- Physical element (*corpus*)
    - Sufficient and effective control
    - Does not need to be constant -- must be exclusive and afford immediate access
        - an agent may possess with the understanding that it is on your behalf
        - varies accoring to the type of property (moveable/immovable)
- Openness
    - Immovables are always possessed openly
    - Visible, obvious, patent; no secrecy or hiding
    - Movables are tricky
        - Test is objective: could it have come to the attention of an owner,
            by exercising reasonable care, that his thing was in the possession
            of the aquirer? To wit, would they have been able to find it?
            - Owner should have ability to interrupt by *actio rei vindicatio*
        - *The University of Fort Hare v Wavelengths 256 (Pty) Ltd* 2010 JDR 1393 (WCC)
            - Judgement criticised: harder to establish prescription which
                brings legal certainty by aligning the *de jure* with the *de
                facto*
            - Strict approach
            - Brings vagueness to openness -- what should I do to satisfy this
                requirement?
            - Theory of property for personhood


### Time Period
- Most movables will not last 30 years
- Sum of current possessor and all predecessors in title (except actual owner)
    - All possessors must meet other requirements
- Interupted by consent, must restart when contrary to owner's interests again


## Provisions of the 1969 Act


## Section 2
- Prescription is not interrupted if
    - Legal proceedings are instituted within 6 months to restore possession
    - Poession is restored within 1 year by any lawful means

## Section 4
- To interrupt prescription judicially, all of the following must be met:
1. Service of any document instituting legal proceedings; and
2. Obtain judgement; and
3. Execute judgement.
- If all are not met, prescription was never interrupted.


## Section 3
- If there is any impediment which prevents enforcement of ownership rights
    - eg: minority, legal capactiy
- Must exist within the last 3 years of prescription
- We stop counting and wait
- Owner is given a further 3 years to enforce ownership rights
    - From the time of expiry of the impediment
