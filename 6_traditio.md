# Acquisition of Ownership: *Traditio*


## *Traditio General*
- *Traditio* = delivery
- Requirement for the transfer of ownership of moveables
    - Ownership will not transfer in a moveable unless there has been payment
        of the purchase price/credit granted and some form of delivery
- Must be a recognised form of delivery
- Doctrine of notice: the law requires ***animus*** and some **public action**
    - we cannot read people's minds
    - something external and public which provides proof of transfer
    - infer *animus* from actions

## Types of Delivery


### Actual Delivery
- Something is actually handed over
- The rest of the forms of delivery are called **constructive delivery**


### *Clavium Traditio*
- Symbolic delivery
- An instrument (the symbol) is handed over which gives the transferee
    **exclusive access** to the *res*
    - eg: key for car/container/warehouse
    - Bill of Lading
- Ownership transfers when instrument is handed over


### *Traditio Longa Manu*
- Delivery with the long hand
- The *res* is too large to by physically handed over
- Must be **separated**, **identified** and **pointed out** to the transferee
    - Some method of unique identification
    - Parties must know exactly what is transferred
- Transferee must be able to take **immediate possession**


### *Traditio Brevi Manu*
- Delivery with the short hand
- Transferee is already in possession of the goods at the time of transfer
    - Renting
    - Borrowing
    - Repairing
    - ...etc
- Ownership passes without any movement of the *res*
- Fictional form of delivery
    - No evidence to an observer
    - Documentation is extremely important
        - Consent, agreement & payment
- Open to fraud & abuse because proof is harder


### *Constitutum Possessorium*
- Possessory agreement
- *Res* remains with transferor (previous owner) even after the sale
- Fictional form of delivery
    - No evidence to an observer
- Transferor retains property in a **new capacity** as a result of a
    **different transaction/agreement/contract**


### Attornment
- *Res* must be in possession of a third party
- Tripartite agreement
    - 3rd party **must agree** that *res* is now being held on behalf of the
        new owner


### Immovables
- All land has a title deed with the name of the owner
- There must be a **written** purchase and sale agreement
- The registrar endorses the transfer (Deeds Registry Act)
