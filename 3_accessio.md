# 3. Acquisition of Ownership: *Accessio*


## General
- *Accessio* is the means by which one corporeal thing is joined (or *acceeds*)
    to another corporeal thing to produce a single composite *res*
- The two (or more) *res* might appear separate, but **functionally and legally they are
    one.** Eg:
    - A diamond acceeds to a ring
    - A button acceeds to a jacket
- *Accessio* results in one *res* becoming the **principle** thing, and others
    becoming **accessory** things
    - The owner of the principle thing becomes owner of the composite
        unilaterally by operation of law
    - The accessory loses its legal identity: it cannot be sold or negotiated
    - The owner of the accessory is no longer owner
        - May have a claim based on unjustified enrichment
- The operation of *accessio* ensures legal certainty by conforming with the
    publicity principle
    - Accession depends on objectivity: subjective intention should not be able
        to contradict the obvious observation of a third-party.
    - Consider the contrary: it is absurd to consider that one person might own
        a single button on another's jacket


## Types of *Accessio*
- Your first task is to identify the type of accession as this will determine
    which rules you must apply:
    1. moveable &rarr; moveable
    2. moveable &rarr; immovable
    3. immovable &rarr; immovable


### 1. Moveable &rarr; Moveable
- The joined property *appear and operate as one*
- Requirements of the join:
    - The principle and accessory should be identifiable
    - Must not give rise to manufacture (*specificatio*)
    - Should not be "easy" to separate
        - Easy = without cost, without effort, without decreasing the value of
            the components
        - This is not always satisfactory -- see next point below
    - Should impart some degree of permanence
- Tests for principle and accessory:
    - There is no single judicially sanctioned test
        - Which is more valuable?
        - Which has more bulk/mass?
        - What is the purpose of each thing?
    - Courts prefer: Which of the components forms the final identity of the
        newly created object? Consider: character, form and function (*Khan v Minister of
        Law and Order* 1991 (3) SA 439 (T))


### 2. Moveable &rarr; Immovable
- Land is always the principle *res*, moveables always the accessory
- *Inaedificatio* = processes by which a moveable joins to land by *industry* (building)
- Anything which has roots in the soil joins by *natural* means
    - exception: plant nurseries where the join is not permanent
- Tests for *accessio*:
    - Courts agree on the following 3 factors, not how they are weighed:
        1. Nature and purpose of the moveable *res*
            - Is this something that ought to be joined to an immovable?
        2. Degree and manner of annexation
            - Can the join be removed withot injuring the property?
            - A secure join is *not neccesarily* definitive
        3. Intention of the owner of the moveable
            - *Ipse dixit* -- expressed or professed intention (subjective)
            - How securely is it attached?
            - Is there some agreement in place showing intention?
            - This is controversial as original acquisition should not rely on
                the subjective state of the owner (does not require their
                co-operation or consent)
    - Traditional vs New Approach
        - (1) and (2) may be observed (objective)
        - **Traditional approach**: only when (1) and (2) are equivocal, resort to (3)
            - *McDonald Ltd v Radin NO and the Potchefstroom Dairies & Industries Co
                Ltd* 1915 AD 454 -- court applied (3)
            - *Standard-Vacuum Refining Co of SA (Pty) Ltd v Durban City Council*
                1961 (2) SA. 669 (A) -- not necessary to apply (3)
        - **New approach**: (1), (2) and (3) are weighed together
            - *Theatre Investments (Pty) Ltd v Butcher Brothers Ltd* 1978 (3) SA 682 (A)
        - **Confused Courts**
            - Courts in these matters conflated original with derivative
                acquisition
            - Focused almost exclusively on the contract/intention
            - *Konstanz Properties (Pty) Ltd v Wm Spilhaus en Kie* (WP) Bpk 1996 (3) SA 273 (A)
            - *Melcorp SA v Joint Municipal Pension Fund Tvl* 1980 (2) SA 214 (W)
        - Pope's Criticism (read the article!)
            - Dilemma when derivative acquisition meets original acquisition
            - Publicity principle: actions of owner make it look like
                *accessio* has occurred
                - This should be the deciding factor
            - Moveable cannot acceed or not based on the payment of debt
                - Impossible situation: a payment of debt in the future
                    retroactively creates *accessio* in the past
                - *Accessio* becomes dependent upon an unknown event
            - Demands of business overriding requirements of *accessio*
