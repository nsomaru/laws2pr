# 2. Acquisition of Ownership: *Occupatio*

## General
- *Occupatio* refers to appropriation
- *Occupatio* provides a means to acquire property that has no owner (*res
    nullius* proper or *res derilictae*)
- Method of original acquisition of ownership


## Requirements for *Occupatio*
- There are 3 requirements for *occupatio*: (1) *res nullius*, (2) *animus domini* and (3) *effective physical control*


### 1. *Res Nullius*
- Typically only wild animals are *res nullius* proper in South Africa. Game
    Theft Act alters the common law:
    - Animal concerned must be regarded as "game" under the act
        - Domestic animals are regarded as any other form of property (not game)
    - Game does not revert to *res nullius* upon escape
    - Certificate must be issued for all game covered under the act
    - Unauthorised capture or kill does not result in ownership.
        - If a certificate exists, game remains property of the owner
        - Else, property of person on whose land they were captured
- *Res derilictae* -- abandoned property
    - Must be *physically and mentally* abandoned by the previous owner
    - Actions of the owner or circumstances of the property drive the inference
        of the court in determining the previous owner's state of mind
    - There is a presumption against abandonment of things of value, they are
        assumed lost (*res despidartae*)


### 2. *Animus Domini*
- *Animus domini* is the intent or mindset of an owner
- It is **not the intention to *become* owner**
    - Intention to become owner negates *occupatio* because it **acknowledges a
        superior title**
- There is no recognition of superior title
- The intent may change over time, *animus domini* may be shown to exist at
    some time after possession


### 3. Sufficient and Effective Physical Control
- This is the *corpus* element
- The nature of the property determines the requirements for extent of control
- Eg: *R v Mafohla and Another* 1958 (2) SA 373 (SR) deals with requirements
    for physical control of a wild animal
