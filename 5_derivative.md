# 5. Acquisition of Ownership: Derivative


## General
- Derivative acquisition of ownership is **bilateral**
    - Both parties consent & co-operate
        - Not always: succession, marriage COP, insolvency (by operation of law)
    - Title of the new owner is **derived** from the title of the previous
        owner
- Usually 3 reasons for transfer of ownership:
    1. Sale of property
    2. Donation
    3. Exchange

- If you steal something you do not be come the owner!
    - Absolute principle: *nemo plus iuris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse haberet*
        - "Nobody can transfer more rights than they have"


## Requirements for the Transaction
1. ***Causa*** -- underlying commericial transaction (contract)
2. **Real agreement** -- transfer of ownership
    - The agreement in relation to the thing
- (1) & (2) are usually simultaneous, but not always

### Why These Requirements?
- You need to know who you can enforce your rights against
- *Causa* gives rise to **personal rights**
    - Enforceable against another person
    - Usually arise from contract & delict
- Real agreement gives rise to **real rights**
    - Enforceable against the world
- Property law deals with real rights
    - **Limited real rights** are rights in the property of another (eg:
        servitude)
- Interesting consequence: you can sell something without actually owning it
    - Contract of sale is a commitment to permanent and undistrubed use &
        enjoyment
    - Sale does not necessarily include a transfer of ownership


### Full List of Requirements
- Thing is *res in commercio*
    - Negotiable & has value
- Parties must have **legal capacity** and must **consent**
    - *Animus* -- intention to transfer and receive ownership
- Putative or *iusta causa*
- Moveable cash sale: purchase price must be paid
- Moveable credit sale: once credit has been granted and delivery effected
    - Risky: creditor cannot institute *actio rei vindicatio*
- Immovable: registration at the Deeds Office
- Must be a recognised form of delivery


### Causal Theory of Ownership
- Rejected by the courts
- Requires *iusta causa*
- If the initial *causa* was deficient, it and subsequent transfers are void
- This is problematic from a commercial point of view, many sales will need to
    be rolled back


### Abstract Theory of Ownership
- Endorsed by the courts
- Real agreement and delivery are abstracted from the *causa*
- Requires merely putative *causa*
    - Acts like a *causa* even if faulty
    - Sufficient for ownership to transfer
    - Brings about legal certainty
